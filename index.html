            <h2>Investigation</h2>
            <h3>What is an orthosis?</h3>
            <h5>By Dylan and Toto Burgos</h5>
            <p>An orthosis is a device used to support, stabilize, or correct a specific part of my body, such as a joint or bone, that may be injured, weakened, or deformed. Orthoses are designed to help me improve the function of that body part, protecting it from movements that can cause further damage, relieving pain, and promoting faster recovery. They can also improve the posture and alignment of the affected parts, allowing me to perform my daily activities more comfortably and safely. They are custom-made to fit my needs and can be made of different materials such as plastics, metals, or flexible fabrics, depending on the type of support I need..</p>
            <h3>Our product </h3>
            <p>Our product is a dynamic assisted orthosis designed to help people who have suffered an accident, surgery or injury and who, as a result, have difficulty moving a limb correctly.</p>
            <p>This device incorporates a mechanical assistance system that allows the user to regain mobility without the need for additional aids, such as canes or crutches. It also features an integrated vibration system designed to improve blood circulation, relieve pain, and provide muscle relaxation, thus contributing to a more efficient and comfortable recovery.</p>
            <p>With this orthosis, we seek to offer an innovative solution that combines technology and ergonomics to improve the quality of life of users, facilitating their mobility and well-being.</p>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>They incorporate electric motors that generate assisted movement. Sensors detect the user's movement intent. A microprocessor analyzes the data and adjusts the strength and speed of the movement..</p>
            <p>They use small electric motors located in different areas of the orthosis. They generate low-frequency vibrations that can help with muscle relaxation or circulation. They allow you to adjust the intensity and duration of the vibrations..</p>
            <h3>Materials</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Polyurethane and EVA foams: Provide comfort and shock absorption.</li>
                <li>Neoprene: Used in elastic and sports orthoses.</li>
                <li>Polyethylene: Light and resistant.</li>
                <li>Acrylic resins: Used in combination with glass or carbon fibers for greater strength.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Uses and Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improves leg alignment.</li>
                <li>Increases stability when walking.</li>
                <li>Reduces the risk of falls.</li>
                <li>Prevents musculoskeletal deformities.</li>
                <li>Facilitates rehabilitation after injury or surgery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How do we plan to finance it?</h2>
            <h5>By Felix Manuel Najera Caamal</h5>
            <p>For this new product that we will implement and put on sale, the first thing that is needed is to gather specific information and data on the elements that are being analyzed.</p>
            <p>The analysis will depend on the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The size of the company</li>
                <li>Available staff</li>
                <li>Production process characteristics</li>
                <li>Strategic planning</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Collect all the above information to measure the profitability of our product, and based on this, know how the income and expenses of the company's activity are reflected in an orderly manner, directly establishing the profits and losses of the financial year to be carried out.</p>
            <h3>Description of the product</h3>
            <p> The motorized orthosis is an innovative device designed to improve blood circulation and accelerate rehabilitation for patients with musculoskeletal injuries or problems. Its vibrating function helps reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and improve mobility.</p>
            <h3>Target market</h3>
            <p> The product is aimed at patients undergoing rehabilitation from accidents, orthopedic surgeries, or musculoskeletal conditions. The main potential customers include physical therapy clinics, hospitals, and individuals requiring home-based recovery therapies.</p>
            <h3>Profitability justification</h3>
            <p>Given the growing interest in rehabilitation technologies and the demand for non-invasive solutions for pain management and mobility, powered orthoses have a high profitability potential in the market.</p>

                <li>Contribution margin per unit: $3,000</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Gross margin</h3>
            <p>The gross margin is calulated as:</p>
            <p>Gross margin=((Total income - Total expenses)/Total income) x 100</p>
            <p>The gross margin on the sale of 50 units is approximately 20%.</p>
            <h3>Net margin</h3> 
            <p>The Net margin is calculated as:</p>
            <p>Net margin= (Net utility/Total income)x 100</p>
            <p>Taking into account the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Net utility: $85,000 MXM</li>
                <li>Total income: $435,000 MXM</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We got that our net margin is aproximately 20%</p>
            <h3>Break-even point</h3>
            <p>In order to cover the fixed costs:</p>
            <p>Break-even point= fixed costs/ contribution margin per unit=</p>
            <p>=$65,000/%3,000 = 22 units</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
                <h3>Expected profitability</h3>
                <p>With the sale of 50 units per month, a net margin of $85,000 MXN is obtained, demonstrating that the product is profitable and sustainable. The product's contribution margin is $3,000 MXN per unit. This represents the difference between the sales price ($8,500 MXN) and the variable cost per unit ($5,500 MXN). This margin contributes to covering fixed costs and generating profits.</p>
                <p>Contribution margin=(Contribution margin/Sale price)x100</p>
                <p>Contribution margin=(3,000/8,500)x100 = 35,3%</p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The motorized orthosis has strong potential in the rehabilitation market. Strategic planning and financial analysis indicate that the product can be profitable, provided at least 22 monthly sales are achieved to cover fixed costs. With a good marketing strategy and partnerships with healthcare institutions, the company can achieve attractive profitability.</p>
